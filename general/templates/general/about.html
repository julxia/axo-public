Hello and welcome! My name is Barbarah Heimer and I have the honor of serving as the president of the Theta Omicron chapter of Alpha Chi Omega at MIT. It is my great pride to introduce you to who we are. 
<br><br>
So, who are we? I am originally from Brazil and, coming from a place that has no Greek life whatsoever, I have had to grapple with explaining what Alpha Chi Omega is on more than one occasion to my relatives. 
<br><br>
To begin to answer this question, let’s start with who we are historically. Alpha Chi Omega was founded in 1885 in DePauw University by seven “Real. Strong. Women.” In 1985, Alpha Chi Omega came to MIT, as a group of MIT women who called themselves the “Thalians” were looking for a national sorority to affiliate with. The “Thalians” ended up selecting Alpha Chi Omega because it was friendly, supportive, and in tune with their values. 
<br><br>
Speaking of values, the tagline I mentioned earlier “Real. Strong. Women.”, as well as our motto “Together let us seek the heights”, both encompass what Alpha Chi Omega stands for. We value empathy, kindness, support, and empowerment. We value friendship, leadership, learning, and service. We value genuineness. We value strength. We value women.
<br><br>
Now, at this point, my relatives are usually still very confused. So, I attempt to re-address “Who are we?” by answering “What do we do?”
<br><br>
As an organization that values women, we seek to support and celebrate women both inside and outside of our chapter. In fact, our philanthropy is domestic violence awareness. The women of Alpha Chi Omega believe that domestic violence is a global issue that needs a strong voice. We stand behind this cause to help make our community and world a safer and brighter place for all individuals affected by domestic violence. As a chapter, we work to promote and educate on healthy relationships within our MIT community and shed light on the characteristics and dangers of domestic violence. 
<br><br>
As individual sisters, we are involved in an array of organizations and endeavors. Our sisters are putting spaceships on the moon, developing the next wave of groundbreaking consumer electronic products, publishing papers on climate change, and researching cancer treatments. Our sisters are also dancing and choreographing in dance crews, singing and playing instruments in orchestras and a cappella groups, teaching and mentoring children in outreach programs. 
<br><br>
After going on for a couple of minutes about the amazing feats of my sisters and still sensing a lack of comprehension from my relatives’ blank stares, I usually conclude with the following:
<br><br>
The Theta Omicron chapter of Alpha Chi Omega at MIT is a group of talented, kind women, in which I have found a home and a lifetime network of sisters that I know I can rely on for happy and sad moments and that will help me be the brightest and best version of myself. 
<br><br>
Thank you for stopping by our website, and I hope I have helped clarify what a sorority, and more specifically what Alpha Chi Omega, is.
